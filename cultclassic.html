        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          One night in New York City's Chinatown, a woman is at a work reunion
          dinner with former colleagues when she excuses herself to buy a pack
          of cigarettes. On her way back, she runs into a former boyfriend. And
          then another. And . . . another. Soon nothing is quite what it seems
          as the city becomes awash with ghosts of heartbreaks past. <br />
          <br />
          What would normally pass for coincidence becomes something far
          stranger as our heroine, the recently engaged Lola, must contend not
          only with the viability of her current relationship but the fact that
          both her best friend and her former boss, a magazine editor turned
          mystical guru, might have an unhealthy investment in the outcome.
          Memories of the past swirl and converge in ways both comic and eerie,
          as Lola is forced to decide if she will surrender herself to the
          conspiring of one very contemporary cult. <br />
          <br />
          Is it possible to have a happy ending in an age when the past is ever
          at your fingertips and sanity is for sale? With her gimlet eye, Sloane
          Crosley spins a wry literary fantasy that is equal parts page-turner
          and poignant portrayal of alienation.
