        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Tanzania, 1964. When Katie Barstow, A-list actress, and her new
          husband, David Hill, decide to bring their Hollywood friends to the
          Serengeti for their honeymoon, they envision giraffes gently eating
          leaves from the tall acacia trees, great swarms of wildebeests
          crossing the Mara River, and herds of zebras storming the sandy
          plains. Their glamorous guests—including Katie’s best friend, Carmen
          Tedesco, and Terrance Dutton, the celebrated Black actor who stars
          alongside Katie in the highly controversial film Tender Madness—will
          spend their days taking photos, and their evenings drinking chilled
          gin and tonics back at camp, as the local Tanzanian guides warm water
          for their baths. The wealthy Americans expect civilized adventure:
          fresh ice from the kerosene-powered ice maker, dinners of cooked
          gazelle meat, and plenty of stories to tell over lunch back on Rodeo
          Drive.<br />
          <br />What Katie and her glittering entourage do not expect is this: a
          kidnapping gone wrong, their guides bleeding out in the dirt, and a
          team of Russian mercenaries herding their hostages into Land Rovers,
          guns to their heads. As the powerful sun gives way to night, the
          gunmen shove them into abandoned huts and Katie Barstow, Hollywood
          royalty, prays for a simple thing: to see the sun rise one more time.
          A blistering story of fame, race, love, and death set in a world on
          the cusp of great change, The Lioness is a vibrant masterpiece from
          one of our finest storytellers.
