        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Though they look like any other family, they aren’t one—not quite.
          They are three sets of parents who find themselves intertwined after
          adopting four biological siblings, having committed to keeping the
          children as connected as possible. <br />
          <br />
          At the heart of the family, the adoptive mothers grapple to define
          themselves and their new roles. Tabitha, who adopted the twins, crowns
          herself planner of the group, responsible for endless playdates and
          holidays, determined to create a perfect happy family. Quiet and
          steady Ginger, single mother to the eldest daughter, is wary of the
          way these complicated not-fully-family relationships test her long
          held boundaries. And Elizabeth, still reeling from rounds of failed
          IVF, is terrified that her unhappiness after adopting a newborn means
          she was not meant to be a mother at all. <br />
          <br />
          As they set out on their first family vacation, all three are pushed
          into uncomfortably close quarters. And when they receive a call from
          their children’s birth mother announcing she is pregnant again, the
          delicate bonds the women are struggling to form threaten to collapse
          as they each must consider how a family is found and formed.
