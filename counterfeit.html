        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Money can’t buy happiness… but it can buy a decent fake. <br />
          <br />
          Ava Wong has always played it safe. As a strait-laced, rule-abiding
          Chinese American lawyer with a successful surgeon as a husband, a
          young son, and a beautiful home—she’s built the perfect life. But
          beneath this façade, Ava’s world is crumbling: her marriage is falling
          apart, her expensive law degree hasn’t been used in years, and her
          toddler’s tantrums are pushing her to the breaking point. <br />
          <br />
          Enter Winnie Fang, Ava’s enigmatic college roommate from Mainland
          China, who abruptly dropped out under mysterious circumstances. Now,
          twenty years later, Winnie is looking to reconnect with her old
          friend. But the shy, awkward girl Ava once knew has been replaced with
          a confident woman of the world, dripping in luxury goods, including a
          coveted Birkin in classic orange. The secret to her success? Winnie
          has developed an ingenious counterfeit scheme that involves importing
          near-exact replicas of luxury handbags and now she needs someone with
          a U.S. passport to help manage her business—someone who’d never be
          suspected of wrongdoing, someone like Ava. But when their spectacular
          success is threatened and Winnie vanishes once again, Ava is left to
          face the consequences. <br />
          <br />
          Swift, surprising, and sharply comic, Counterfeit is a stylish and
          feminist caper with a strong point of view and an axe to grind.
          Peering behind the curtain of the upscale designer storefronts and the
          Chinese factories where luxury goods are produced, Kirstin Chen
          interrogates the myth of the model minority through two unforgettable
          women determined to demand more from life.
