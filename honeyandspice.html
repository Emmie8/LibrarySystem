        <p>
          Sweet like plantain, hot like pepper. They taste the best when
          together... <br />
          <br />
          Sharp-tongued (and secretly soft-hearted) Kiki Banjo has just made a
          huge mistake. As an expert in relationship-evasion and the host of the
          popular student radio show Brown Sugar, she’s made it her mission to
          make sure the women of the African-Caribbean Society at Whitewell
          University do not fall into the mess of “situationships”, players, and
          heartbreak. But when the Queen of the Unbothered kisses Malakai
          Korede, the guy she just publicly denounced as “The Wastemen of
          Whitewell,” in front of every Blackwellian on campus, she finds her
          show on the brink. <br />
          <br />
          They’re soon embroiled in a fake relationship to try and salvage their
          reputations and save their futures. Kiki has never surrendered her
          heart before, and a player like Malakai won’t be the one to change
          that, no matter how charming he is or how electric their connection
          feels. But surprisingly entertaining study sessions and intimate,
          late-night talks at old-fashioned diners force Kiki to look beyond her
          own presumptions. Is she ready to open herself up to something deeper?
          <br />
          <br />
          A gloriously funny and sparkling debut novel, Honey and Spice is full
          of delicious tension and romantic intrigue that will make you weak at
          the knees.
